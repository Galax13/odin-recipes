            <li>In a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.</li>
            <li>In the mixing bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed just until smooth and combined.</li>
            <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, stopping and scraping down the bowl occasionally. Then, beat in the milk and 1½ teaspoon of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Slowly beat in the flour mixture on low speed. Beat just until combined, and the batter is thick but smooth. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>Spread homemade whipped cream over the jam. Top with the other cake layer. Dust the top of the Victoria sponge cake with additional confectioners’ sugar before serving</li>
